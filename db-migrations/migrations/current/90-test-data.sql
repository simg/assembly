As ex-military (25 years service) I slept on the ground hundreds of times, ants were more of an issue than cockroaches. While I have your attention, in my 75 years I have seen probably no more than a dozen snakes in the wild, they are timid animals and will get out of your way as quick as they can. Aussie spiders do not usually attack people, we are too big to eat so they will not waste their time. Kangaroos are more dangerous than spiders, and most Roos will hop away, even dingos run away. Mind you when I am in the Far North I am very aware of crocodiles and in the ocean there are sharks, but staistically one is more likely to be hit by lightening than be attacked by a croc or a shark (especially if one stays out of the water). In these Covid-19 days Australia is probably one of the safest countries on the planet."}}]'),
  (3, 2, '[{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"My son married a Japanese woman he met in Silicon Valley. Even before they were engaged, she was taking him to Japan to meet her family, none of whom speak English. He liked Japan so much that he agreed to make it their retirement home, then to move there before they were ready to retire. But early in their courtship, he realized that if he continued to visit Japan, he needed to learn the language to converse with his in-laws. It took him ten years of Saturday-morning lessons, plus practicing at home with his wife, but he became fluent. Once they moved, he landed a job in a Tokyo office after an interview conducted entirely in Japanese. In 2019 he took me on my dream trip to Germany. On our first morning in Munich, we reported to where the tour buses loaded. There happened to be a lot of Japanese tourists in Germany at the same time because the entire week was a holiday in their country. Two Japanese women who didn’t speak German appeared to be confused about which bus they were supposed to take. My son stepped forward and asked if he could help them. I wish I had a photo of their faces as they realized he was speaking their language; their astonishment was priceless. So I can’t speak for every native Japanese, but I can say with confidence that his boss and two tourists are impressed. For that matter, so is my daughter-in-law."}}]'),
  (3, 2, '[{"type":"paragraph","data":{"text":"Yes. In a word, Japanese are impressed with western foreigners who can speak Japanese at a high level of fluency. Writing and reading fluently will absolutely amplify that effect. Why? Every Quoran who might respond will likely provide a different answer. There is no one single reason, but there are three that come to mind:  Japanese are trained that everything has a specific way. And that “way” must be followed regardless of evidence to the contrary. Japanese spend years learning their own language using this “way” and still struggle. Therefore, a non-native speaker is always a surprise.  After 6 years of English education, Many Japanese are still unable to carry on a normal conversation in English. So by comparison a foreigner who has mastered Japanese is a surprise.  There are still few western foreigners in places where Japanese live. Western foreigners and Japanese do not have frequent opportunites to interact and thus meeting any foreigner up close is still a rarity. A foreigner who speaks rather well is treated with surprise. There is more to this. Because even for those Japanese who are around foreigners who speak Japanese well, there is always some hidden facet of Japanese that is not taught in schools, yet is known intuitively among native speakers. Foreigners who speak well may unknowingly break one of these hidden rules and thereby cause a strange response from their Japanese host. This response may appear to be disdain or even negative toward the foreign speaker. But it is not premeditated. Let me provide a small example: In most language schools “konnichi wa” is taught to mean “good afternoon”. This is both for Japanese and English schools. So both Japanese speakers and English speakers are taught a falsehood that seems correct but is not!  Actually, there are a few problems with this construct that even native Japanese speakers are not aware of. does konnichiwa mean good afternoon? The answer is no. Konnichiwa is written 今日は or “As for today…”. Konnichiwa is an abbreviated sentence 今日はご機嫌は如何で御座いますか or “As for today, how is your contenance (as compared to the last time we met). Quite a mouthful and quite a formal greeting. It is not meant to be used on a daily basis with people who are in your inner circle! Who can you say “konnichiwa” to? See above. You would not use this with people in your inner circle. So the mail delivery person, a store clerk, a customer and someone who may not have seen in some time are ok. Certainly not your co-worker, Spouse, friend, or close family member. The minute you use this phrase you are drawing a distinction of emotional distance between yourself and that person. (A husband and wife who say konnichiwa to each other are likely not close and possibly living apart or about to divorce!) Using this one word with a person in your inner circle indicates you have just pushed them away! So your “perfect Japanese” is now causing double jeopardy. If you were speaking Japanese poorly, you would be excused for making this unknowable mistake. However, as an accomplished speaker, you no longer get a pass for such a faux pas. Yet the Japanese speaker doesn’t even know that you made a faux pas! They only feel alienated and they don’t know why!!! Good afternoon in English is used for a specific time period (after 11:59:59 am) while the Japanese phrase is used after “good morning” and before “good evening”. (And both of those phrases are loaded as well!) So the lost communication is not apparent to either party. All that remains is the bad feeling [that was clearly not intended]. So yes, fluent speakers are impressive because so much about Japanese is unknown *even to the Japanese themselves* So keep practicing and contine learning! And of course please continue impressing your Japanese friends. (In a nice way!) Thanks for a great question. （╹◡╹）"}}]');
